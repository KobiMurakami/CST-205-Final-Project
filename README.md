 This project uses threads to display the loading bars. This feature may not work properly on Windows 11
 and may crash the program. It works fine on my Windows 10 PC but I was not able to get it to work on my Windows 11 laptop.
 To make testing go well, try and open on a Windows 10 machine.
 If you are still experiencing crashes, a photo example of the project functioning is provided in the file structure.
 It works fine on my machine but still has issues on others and I was not able to pinpoint what the issue was.

Future Work: In the future, an image cropping feature should be implemented.
On top of that, there could also be a more options for preset color grading.
